# Object Tracking using YOLOv3, Deep Sort and Tensorflow
This repository implements YOLOv3 and Deep SORT in order to perfrom real-time object tracking. Yolov3 is an algorithm that uses deep convolutional neural networks to perform object detection. We can feed these object detections into Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric) in order for a real-time object tracker to be created.

### Reference code

For the baseline code of object detection and tracking, refer to this [GitHub][link]. Environment also set in the same way as this link.
